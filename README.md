# kataBankAccount
A small exercise with some prexisting guidelines.

Requirements:
 - Deposit and Withdrawal
 - Transfer
 - ( Account statement (date, amount, balance) optional )

The Rules
1. One level of indentation per method
2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
4. First class collections // (does this mean anything in Java?)
5. One dot per line // (I find it useless as it goes against what my favorite practice for printstream and instance variable access (this) )
6. Don’t abbreviate
7. Keep all entities small (50 lines)
8. No classes with more than two instance variables
9. No getters/setters/properties
